description: Navigate the GitHub Advanced Security capability surface in Agent CLI OS. Use when the task is about GHAS rollout, CodeQL, code scanning, secret scanning, Dependabot alerts, dependency review, or deciding between `gh`, `gh codeql`, `ghas-cli`, and GitHub security APIs.

# GitHub Security Capability

## Skill Stability Rule

- Treat this skill as stable infrastructure.
- Never create, edit, rename, move, or delete this skill during normal task execution.
- Only touch skill files when the user explicitly asks to change the skill system itself and has confirmed `skill-edit-mode`.

## Overview

Use this as the thin navigation layer for GitHub Advanced Security work. The authoritative routes are `gh api` for security endpoints, `gh codeql` for local CodeQL tooling, and `ghas-cli` for rollout-at-scale work when that CLI is healthy.

## Workflow

1. Run `agentcli capability github-advanced-security`.
2. Read the generated page at `docs/agent-cli-os/capabilities/github-advanced-security.md` under the active `CODEX_HOME`.
3. Prefer `ghas-cli` for GHAS enablement and rollout across many repositories when it is healthy.
4. Prefer `gh codeql` for local CodeQL CLI management, version pinning, and query workflows.
5. Prefer `gh api` for code scanning, secret scanning, Dependabot, and dependency review alert inspection or targeted automation.
6. If the task turns out to be generic GitHub repo/PR/issue work rather than GHAS, switch to `$github-capability`.

## Rules

- Do not assume the generic GitHub plugin skills cover GHAS-specific work; they currently do not provide first-class GHAS workflow coverage.
- Treat `ghas-cli` as optional enhancement, not the only path. If it is degraded, use `gh api` and `gh codeql`.
- Keep security work capability-first: choose the GitHub security route before thinking about CLI, plugin, or API transport details.

## Do Not Do

- Do not duplicate GHAS operational logic in this skill.
- Do not silently trust `ghas-cli` if `agentctl` reports it as degraded.
- Do not bypass `agentctl` when health, auth, or overlap is unclear.
