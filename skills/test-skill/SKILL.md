name: test-skill
description: General cross-repo testing implementation and refactoring workflow for backend and frontend code. Use when adding or updating tests for new code, when the user says to add all needed tests for a feature or refactor, when fixing bugs with permanent regression coverage, when choosing the right mix of unit, integration, end-to-end, browser smoke, accessibility, contract, visual, or edge-case testing, or when tightening CI quality gates without test drift. This skill should add the right tests, run them, and keep iterating until the relevant suites are green, fixing product code when a correct test reveals a real defect instead of weakening the test just to pass. Prefer repo-native CLIs first, then dedicated testing CLIs such as Playwright CLI, and only use MCP-style browser control when CLI workflows cannot provide enough signal. Not for full-repo checklist audits or execute-until-done remediation; use test-deep-audit for that.

# Test Skill

## Skill Stability Rule

- Treat this skill as stable infrastructure.
- Never create, edit, rename, move, or delete this skill's files during normal task execution.
- Only touch skill files when the user explicitly asks to change the skill system itself.
- Even then, do not edit immediately. First ask for explicit confirmation to open `skill-edit-mode` for the named skill or skills.
- If that confirmation is absent, refuse the skill-file edit and continue with non-skill work.

## Repo Artifact Rule

- If this workflow needs helper scripts, fixtures, or generated test helpers, create them in the target repo, not in `$CODEX_HOME`, not in a skill folder, and not in the agentctl bundle unless that bundle repo is the target.
- Prefer repo-native locations such as `scripts/`, `tools/`, `test/helpers/`, `tests/helpers/`, or `.github/scripts/`.

Use this skill for normal testing work across repos. It should make everyday testing decisions consistent, fast, and less brittle, while keeping frontend and backend coverage aligned with the actual risk in the code.

If you cannot load the supporting references for some reason, still follow the defaults in this file.

## What This Skill Covers

- Adding tests for new code
- Adding all needed tests for a newly added feature, subsystem, or refactor
- Refactoring weak or brittle tests
- Converting a bug fix into a permanent regression test
- Choosing the right layer: unit, integration, e2e, accessibility, contract, visual, or edge-case
- Keeping test suites fast and actionable
- Preserving the repo's existing testing stack without unnecessary framework drift

## Use The Companion Audit Skill When Needed

If the request is any of the following, use `$test-deep-audit` instead:

- Full-repo test audit
- Writing or refreshing a checkbox backlog of test gaps
- Working a test checklist until every item is done
- Replying only `ready` when the whole test backlog is complete
- Auditing coverage, flakiness, CI, accessibility, contracts, and edge cases across the entire repo

## Bare Invocation Behavior

If the user explicitly invokes `$test-skill` with no meaningful extra instruction, do a lightweight test-stack inspection and report:

1. the current test frameworks and commands
2. obvious gaps in unit, integration, e2e, and regression coverage
3. the next highest-value tests to add

Do not run a full checklist audit in this mode.

## Required Workflow

1. Inspect the repo first:
   - `package.json`, lockfiles, `pyproject.toml`, `go.mod`, `Cargo.toml`, build files, CI workflows, and test scripts
   - existing test folders, fixtures, mocks, seeds, factories, and reporters
   - any browser or dev-server scripts needed for full-stack tests
2. Prefer the repo's existing test CLI first.
3. If the repo does not already define the exact testing path you need, load the right references from this skill:
   - Always: `references/strategy.md`, `references/test-review.md`
   - Unit or integration work: `references/unit-and-integration.md`
   - Browser, e2e, or smoke verification: `references/browser-and-e2e.md`
   - Regression, accessibility, contracts, visual, edge-case, or mutation work: `references/advanced-quality.md`
   - Ecosystem and prebuilt tools: `references/premade-stack.md`
   - Short reusable prompts: `references/prompt-template.md`
4. Choose the smallest test layer that covers the risk.
5. Implement the tests in repo patterns.
6. Run the smallest correct validation before stopping.
7. If a newly added or updated test fails, determine whether:
   - the test is correct and the product code is wrong
   - the test is wrong, brittle, or asserting the wrong contract
8. Fix the right thing:
   - if the test is correct, fix product code or setup
   - if the test is wrong, fix the test
9. Re-run until the relevant suites are green or a real blocker remains.
10. Report what was verified and what still carries risk.

## Default Testing Posture

- Prefer the repo's current framework over introducing a new one.
- Prefer focused, hermetic tests over sprawling brittle tests.
- Prefer integration tests over over-mocked unit tests when the behavior crosses real module boundaries.
- Keep e2e coverage focused on critical user journeys and cross-page regressions.
- Always add a regression test for a real bug fix when feasible.
- When a correct test fails, prefer fixing product code over weakening the test.
- Prefer CLI-first browser workflows:
  - repo-native test CLI first
  - Playwright CLI or the local `$playwright` skill next
  - MCP/browser automation only when CLI workflows are insufficient

## Tool Defaults

- JavaScript or TypeScript repos: prefer existing runner; if the repo is Vite-oriented or lacks a clear default, Vitest is the best default candidate.
- Browser end-to-end: prefer Playwright Test for persistent suites.
- Browser smoke or exploratory verification: prefer the local `$playwright` skill or `playwright-cli`.
- Accessibility: prefer Playwright plus `@axe-core/playwright`, plus manual keyboard and focus checks.
- Contract testing: prefer Pact or the repo's existing schema or contract layer.
- Edge-case testing: use property-based testing selectively with `fast-check` for critical logic.
- Mutation testing: use Stryker selectively on critical domains, not on the entire repo by default.

## Hard Rules

- Do not introduce a new test framework if the repo already has a working one for the same layer.
- Do not write redundant tests at three layers when one focused layer already covers the risk.
- Do not default to MCP when a CLI or test runner already provides the needed signal.
- Do not generate brittle selector-heavy e2e tests when semantic locators or explicit contracts exist.
- Do not hide unresolved flakiness behind retries without identifying the cause.
- Do not mark a bug fix complete without adding or considering permanent regression coverage.
- Do not weaken assertions or delete meaningful coverage just to make the suite pass.
- Do not keep patching tests when the tests correctly expose broken product behavior.
- Do not stop before checking failure paths, not just happy paths.
