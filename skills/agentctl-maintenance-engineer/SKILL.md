description: Maintain the agentctl control plane itself. Use when checking or refreshing agentctl docs, command-to-doc drift, capability-registry health, maintenance state, plugin packaging, config enablement, cloud-readiness docs, or the machine-readable maintenance report. Trigger after changing agentctl commands, adapters, plugin metadata, maintenance docs, or platform contracts.

# Agentctl Maintenance Engineer

## Overview

Treat `agentctl` as a maintained product. Use the maintenance commands to verify the control plane, refresh its docs, and keep its packaging and state explicit.

## Workflow

1. Run `agentctl maintenance check` first to inspect current health.
2. If docs or packaging drift exists, run `agentctl maintenance audit`.
3. Read the generated outputs before making follow-up changes:
   - `../../docs/agentctl/maintenance.md`
   - `../../docs/agentctl/maintenance-report.json`
   - `../../.codex-workflows/agentctl-maintenance/state.json`
4. If the issue is documentation-only, use `agentctl maintenance fix-docs`.
5. If only the report page needs a refresh, use `agentctl maintenance render-report`.

## Operating Rules

- Keep `agentctl` as the control plane, not as a replacement for vendor CLIs, Playwright, or Codex execution.
- Keep the command surface frozen unless you also update the generated docs and tests.
- Keep cloud-readiness explicit. Local success is not proof of cloud support.
- Do not hand-edit generated maintenance docs unless you are changing the generator itself.

## References

- Read [workflow.md](../../skills/agentctl-maintenance-engineer/references/workflow.md) when you need the exact maintenance commands and artifact paths.
- Read [maintenance-contract.md](../../agentctl/references/maintenance-contract.md) when you are changing the maintenance subsystem itself.
- Read [cloud-readiness.md](../../agentctl/references/cloud-readiness.md) when changes affect cloud assumptions.
