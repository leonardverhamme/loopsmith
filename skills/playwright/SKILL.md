# Playwright CLI Skill

## Skill Stability Rule

- Treat this skill as stable infrastructure.
- Never create, edit, rename, move, or delete this skill's files during normal task execution.
- Only touch skill files when the user explicitly asks to change the skill system itself.
- Even then, do not edit immediately. First ask for explicit confirmation to open `skill-edit-mode` for the named skill or skills.
- If that confirmation is absent, refuse the skill-file edit and continue with non-skill work.

## Repo Artifact Rule

- If browser automation needs helper scripts, snapshots, or saved artifacts, put them in the target repo, not in `$CODEX_HOME`, not in a skill folder, and not in the agentctl bundle unless that bundle repo is the target.
- Prefer repo-native locations such as `output/playwright/`, `artifacts/browser/`, `tmp/browser/`, or `scripts/`.

Drive a real browser from the terminal using `playwright-cli`. Prefer the `playwright.cmd` wrapper when it is on `PATH`; if the current repo bundles agentctl, use the bundle-local `agentctl/playwright.cmd`.
Treat this skill as CLI-first automation. Do not pivot to `@playwright/test` unless the user explicitly asks for test files.

## Prerequisite check (required)

Before proposing commands, check whether `npx` is available (the wrapper depends on it):

```bash
command -v npx >/dev/null 2>&1
```

If it is not available, pause and ask the user to install Node.js/npm (which provides `npx`). Provide these steps verbatim:

```bash
# Verify Node/npm are installed
node --version
npm --version

# If missing, install Node.js/npm, then:
npm install -g @playwright/cli@latest
playwright-cli --help
```

Once `npx` is present, proceed with the wrapper script. A global install of `playwright-cli` is optional.

## Skill path (set once)

PowerShell / Windows:

```powershell
$env:PWCLI = if (Get-Command playwright.cmd -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue) {
  "playwright.cmd"
} elseif (Test-Path ".\\agentctl\\playwright.cmd") {
  (Resolve-Path ".\\agentctl\\playwright.cmd").Path
} elseif ($env:CODEX_HOME -and (Test-Path (Join-Path $env:CODEX_HOME "agentctl\\playwright.cmd"))) {
  (Join-Path $env:CODEX_HOME "agentctl\\playwright.cmd")
} else {
  throw "No playwright wrapper found on PATH, in ./agentctl, or in `$CODEX_HOME\\agentctl."
}
```

Fallback Bash path:

```bash
if command -v playwright.cmd >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  export PWCLI="playwright.cmd"
elif [ -x "./skills/playwright/scripts/playwright_cli.sh" ]; then
  export PWCLI="./skills/playwright/scripts/playwright_cli.sh"
else
  export PWCLI="./agentctl/playwright.cmd"
fi
```

## Quick start

Use the preferred wrapper:

```bash
"$PWCLI" open https://playwright.dev --headed
"$PWCLI" snapshot
"$PWCLI" click e15
"$PWCLI" type "Playwright"
"$PWCLI" press Enter
"$PWCLI" screenshot
```

If the user prefers a global install, this is also valid:

```bash
npm install -g @playwright/cli@latest
playwright-cli --help
```

## Core workflow

1. Open the page.
2. Snapshot to get stable element refs.
3. Interact using refs from the latest snapshot.
4. Re-snapshot after navigation or significant DOM changes.
5. Capture artifacts (screenshot, pdf, traces) when useful.

Minimal loop:

```bash
"$PWCLI" open https://example.com
"$PWCLI" snapshot
"$PWCLI" click e3
"$PWCLI" snapshot
```

## When to snapshot again

Snapshot again after:

- navigation
- clicking elements that change the UI substantially
- opening/closing modals or menus
- tab switches

Refs can go stale. When a command fails due to a missing ref, snapshot again.

## Recommended patterns

### Form fill and submit

```bash
"$PWCLI" open https://example.com/form
"$PWCLI" snapshot
"$PWCLI" fill e1 "user@example.com"
"$PWCLI" fill e2 "password123"
"$PWCLI" click e3
"$PWCLI" snapshot
```

### Debug a UI flow with traces

```bash
"$PWCLI" open https://example.com --headed
"$PWCLI" tracing-start
# ...interactions...
"$PWCLI" tracing-stop
```

### Multi-tab work

```bash
"$PWCLI" tab-new https://example.com
"$PWCLI" tab-list
"$PWCLI" tab-select 0
"$PWCLI" snapshot
```

## Wrapper script

The preferred global wrapper uses `npx --package @playwright/cli playwright-cli` through:

```text
playwright.cmd
```

If the repo bundles agentctl, the equivalent bundle-local path is `agentctl/playwright.cmd`. The legacy Bash skill wrapper still exists for shells that prefer it.

```bash
"$PWCLI" --help
```

Prefer the wrapper unless the repository already standardizes on a global install.

## References

Open only what you need:

- CLI command reference: `references/cli.md`
- Practical workflows and troubleshooting: `references/workflows.md`

## Guardrails

- Always snapshot before referencing element ids like `e12`.
- Re-snapshot when refs seem stale.
- Prefer explicit commands over `eval` and `run-code` unless needed.
- When you do not have a fresh snapshot, use placeholder refs like `eX` and say why; do not bypass refs with `run-code`.
- Use `--headed` when a visual check will help.
- When capturing artifacts in this repo, use `output/playwright/` and avoid introducing new top-level artifact folders.
- Default to CLI commands and workflows, not Playwright test specs.
