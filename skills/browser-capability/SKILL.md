# Browser Capability

## Skill Stability Rule

- Treat this skill as stable infrastructure.
- Never create, edit, rename, move, or delete this skill during normal task execution.
- Only touch skill files when the user explicitly asks to change the skill system itself and has confirmed `skill-edit-mode`.

## Overview

Use this as the thin navigation layer for browser automation. The real browser runtime remains Playwright; this skill only routes into the healthiest browser path.

## Workflow

1. Run `agentcli capability browser-automation`.
2. Read the generated page at `docs/agent-cli-os/capabilities/browser-automation.md`.
3. Prefer `$playwright` and the Playwright CLI when terminal-driven browser work is enough.
4. Use Playwright MCP when the structured MCP interface is the better fit for the task.
5. If the MCP route is locked, stale, or attached to another session, switch to the Playwright CLI wrapper and start a fresh browser session instead of stopping.
6. If the current app port is unavailable or already occupied, rerun the app on another free port and continue the browser pass there.

## Do Not Do

- Do not create a custom browser runtime here.
- Do not choose between CLI and MCP blindly without checking the capability page first.
- Do not accept a locked Playwright session or a busy localhost port as a reason to skip a required browser verification.
