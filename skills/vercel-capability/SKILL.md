# Vercel Capability

## Skill Stability Rule

- Treat this skill as stable infrastructure.
- Never create, edit, rename, move, or delete this skill during normal task execution.
- Only touch skill files when the user explicitly asks to change the skill system itself and has confirmed `skill-edit-mode`.

## Overview

Use this as the thin navigation layer for Vercel work. The real logic stays in the Vercel plugin skills, Vercel CLI, and configured platform interfaces.

## Workflow

1. Run `agentcli capability vercel-platform`.
2. Read the generated page at `docs/agent-cli-os/capabilities/vercel-platform.md`.
3. Prefer the Vercel plugin skills when they already model the task well.
4. Use `vercel` for direct CLI operations such as linking, deployments, logs, or env work.

## Do Not Do

- Do not duplicate Vercel deployment logic in this skill.
- Do not bypass `agentctl` when deciding whether plugin, CLI, or MCP-backed Vercel tooling is the right route.
