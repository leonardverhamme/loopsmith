# Agentctl Maintenance

## Last Run

- Generated: `2026-04-18T16:18:47.569499+00:00`
- Status: `ok`
- Checks passed: 45 / 45
- Open findings: 0
- Blocked findings: 0

## When to Run Maintenance

- After changing `agentctl` commands, adapters, or state contracts.
- After changing plugin metadata, plugin skills, or packaging layout.
- After adding or removing supported CLIs or browser routes.
- Before trusting cloud-readiness assumptions for a new workflow.

## Operator Runbook

1. Run `agentctl maintenance check` for a quick signal.
2. If command surface, docs, or packaging changed, run `agentctl maintenance audit`.
3. Read `maintenance.md`, `maintenance-report.json`, and `.codex-workflows/agentctl-maintenance/state.json` together.
4. If findings are doc-only, prefer `agentctl maintenance fix-docs` over hand edits.
5. Re-run the relevant tests and smoke checks before trusting a green maintenance state.

## What Must Be Updated After Changes

- Refresh `docs/agentctl/*.md` from machine state.
- Review hand-maintained guides such as `README.md`, `zero-touch-setup.md`, `install-on-another-computer.md`, `unattended-worker-setup.md`, and `maintainer-guide.md` when behavior or setup expectations change.
- Keep `state-schema.md`, `capability-registry.md`, and `maintenance-contract.md` aligned with code.
- Re-run tests for `agentctl` and the shared workflow tools.
- Re-run at least one CLI-level deep-workflow smoke after changing runner/state/guard behavior.
- Keep `AGENTS.md` aligned with the intended front door.

## Verification Expectations

- `python -m unittest discover -s agentctl/tests -p "test_*.py"` passes.
- `python -m unittest discover -s workflow-tools/tests -p "test_*.py"` passes.
- A temp-repo `agentctl run <workflow>` smoke can reach a correct terminal state with a real or explicit worker command.
- Fresh bundle install smoke keeps `bootstrap-report.json` truthful and does not fail purely on documented degraded capabilities.

## Clean State Expectations

- `maintenance-report.json` has `status: ok`.
- `.codex-workflows/agentctl-maintenance/state.json` has `status: complete` and `ready_allowed: true`.
- `agentctl doctor` stays compact and health-focused.
- `agentctl capabilities` stays capability-first.
- `agentctl status --all` surfaces durable active workflows and hides stale temp history by default.

## Maintenance Checklist

- [x] No open maintenance findings remain.

## Known Limitations

- `gh skill` is not available locally, so publish/preview wrappers remain disabled.
- The default local Codex runtime is not callable here. Use `agentctl run --worker-command ...` or configure `AGENTCTL_CODEX_WORKER_TEMPLATE` for unattended deep runs.
- `firebase` is detected but intentionally remains detect-only in v1.
- `gcloud` is detected but intentionally remains detect-only in v1.
