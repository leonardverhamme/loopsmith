# Agentctl Capability Registry

The machine-readable registry lives at `agentctl/state/capabilities.json`.

## How To Use This Registry

- Treat `front_door` as the default interface an agent should choose first.
- Treat `backing_interfaces` as implementation detail and health metadata.
- Only care about raw CLI/MCP/plugin distinctions if a capability is degraded or missing.
- Use `overlap_policy` to understand why multiple interfaces collapse into one capability.

## Capability Menu

### Control Plane

- `autonomous-deep-runs` uses `agentctl run` and is currently `ok`.
  - Overlap policy: The outer execute-until-done loop must use a real worker command, not chat memory. Prefer Codex runtime when it is callable or explicitly templated.
  - Advisory: Default Codex runtime is not callable in this environment. Use `--worker-command` or configure `AGENTCTL_CODEX_WORKER_TEMPLATE` for unattended deep runs.
- `skills-management` uses `agentctl skills` and is currently `ok`.
  - Overlap policy: Wrap official skills tooling rather than reimplementing it.
- `agentctl-maintenance` uses `$agentctl-maintenance-engineer` and is currently `ok`.
  - Overlap policy: Keep maintenance as one capability surface for docs, packaging, registry health, and platform drift.

### Workflow Skills

- `context-workflows` uses `$context-skill` and is currently `ok`.
  - Overlap policy: Prefer the lightweight context skill and durable repo docs over deeper automation.
- `ui-workflows` uses `$ui-skill / $ui-deep-audit` and is currently `ok`.
  - Overlap policy: Surface the UI skills first; plugin support stays a backing capability, not a separate menu.
- `test-workflows` uses `$test-skill / $test-deep-audit` and is currently `ok`.
  - Overlap policy: Collapse testing transports behind one testing surface; use repo-native CLIs and Playwright first.
- `docs-workflows` uses `$docs-skill / $docs-deep-audit` and is currently `ok`.
  - Overlap policy: Keep docs work in the docs skills and hide transport details entirely.
- `refactor-workflows` uses `$refactor-skill / $refactor-deep-audit` and is currently `ok`.
  - Overlap policy: Use the local refactor skills as the capability surface; do not split by underlying tooling.
- `cicd-workflows` uses `$cicd-skill / $cicd-deep-audit` and is currently `ok`.
  - Overlap policy: Surface CI/CD by workflow, not by whether GitHub or Vercel provides the underlying route.

### Research And Verification

- `research` uses `agentctl research` and is currently `ok`.
  - Overlap policy: Hide web, GitHub, and browser transport choices behind one research surface and one evidence contract.
- `browser-automation` uses `$playwright` and is currently `ok`.
  - Overlap policy: Treat Playwright CLI and MCP as peer browser backends behind one browser capability.

### Integrations

- `github-workflows` uses `GitHub plugin / gh` and is currently `ok`.
  - Overlap policy: Collapse GitHub plugin skills and gh into one capability entry instead of separate transport menus.
- `vercel-platform` uses `Vercel plugin / vercel` and is currently `ok`.
  - Overlap policy: Keep one Vercel capability entry; plugin and CLI are primary, MCP stays background metadata.
- `supabase-data` uses `supabase + Supabase MCP` and is currently `degraded`.
  - Overlap policy: Keep Supabase as a real dual-route capability because CLI and MCP complement each other.
- `stripe-payments` uses `Stripe plugin` and is currently `missing`.
  - Overlap policy: Prefer the Stripe plugin capability surface; keep MCP as backing metadata, not a separate menu.
- `sentry-observability` uses `Sentry plugin` and is currently `missing`.
  - Overlap policy: Expose Sentry as one observability capability instead of a transport-specific tool entry.
- `ios-development` uses `Build iOS Apps plugin` and is currently `missing`.
  - Overlap policy: Expose iOS build, UI, and debugging workflows as one capability backed by the iOS plugin.
- `macos-development` uses `Build macOS Apps plugin` and is currently `missing`.
  - Overlap policy: Expose macOS build, packaging, and desktop debugging as one capability backed by the macOS plugin.
- `android-testing` uses `Test Android Apps plugin` and is currently `missing`.
  - Overlap policy: Expose Android emulator QA as one capability backed by the Android testing plugin.
- `figma-design` uses `Figma MCP` and is currently `missing`.
  - Overlap policy: No plugin overlap here, so MCP remains the single capability entry.
- `nextjs-runtime` uses `Next DevTools MCP` and is currently `missing`.
  - Overlap policy: Keep Next.js runtime tooling as one capability entry backed by Next DevTools MCP.
