# Zero-Touch Setup

This bundle is designed so an agent can set it up with one command and then use the installed control plane without further user interaction.

## One-Command Bootstrap

From a clone or extracted release bundle:

```powershell
python .\scripts\install_bundle.py
```

From a clean machine where you want a PATH command first:

```powershell
pipx install git+https://github.com/leonardverhamme/agentctl.git
agentctl bootstrap
```

That command:

- installs the bundle into `$CODEX_HOME` or `~/.codex`
- enables the `agentctl` plugin in `config.toml`
- runs the post-install checks against that exact target `CODEX_HOME`
- runs:
  - `agentctl doctor --json`
  - `agentctl capabilities --json`
  - `agentctl maintenance audit --json`
- writes a machine-readable bootstrap report to:
  - `agentctl/state/bootstrap-report.json`

If you want to target a specific Codex home:

```powershell
python .\scripts\install_bundle.py --codex-home C:\Users\you\.codex
```

Or through the package wrapper:

```powershell
agentctl bootstrap --codex-home C:\Users\you\.codex
```

## Recommended Prerequisites

For a fully healthy setup, the machine should have:

- Python 3.12 or later
- Node.js and `npx`
- a Chromium-compatible browser route if browser-backed verification matters

Optional vendor CLIs such as `gh`, `vercel`, and `supabase` can be added later. `agentctl` will discover them when present and report them honestly when missing.

## What The Agent Should Do After Bootstrap

1. Run `agentctl doctor`
2. Run `agentctl capabilities`
3. Use `agentctl` as the first front door for:
   - capability discovery
   - research routing
   - deep workflow launch
   - maintenance checks

If this is a brand-new workstation, also read:

- [install-on-another-computer.md](install-on-another-computer.md)
- [unattended-worker-setup.md](unattended-worker-setup.md)

## Unattended Deep Workflows

Deep checklist workflows only count as unattended when `agentctl run <workflow>` can relaunch a real worker.

Use one of these:

- `--worker-command "<real worker command>"`
- `CODEX_WORKFLOW_WORKER_COMMAND`
- `AGENTCTL_CODEX_WORKER_TEMPLATE`

The runner loop, checklist, state file, and guard are already deterministic. The missing piece in some environments is the worker runtime. If `agentctl doctor` reports that Codex is installed but not callable, keep the workflow explicit until a real worker command is configured.

For the full operator explanation of that loop, use [unattended-worker-setup.md](unattended-worker-setup.md).

## Script Placement Rule

When an installed skill or workflow needs to create helper scripts for a user task, those scripts belong in the target repo being worked on, not in:

- `$CODEX_HOME`
- the `agentctl` bundle repo
- any skill directory under `skills/`
- any plugin skill directory under `plugins/*/skills/`

Use the repo's own `scripts/`, `tools/`, or another repo-local path that matches the project structure.

## Existing Environment Discovery

The installed control plane discovers what is already present and healthy on the machine. It does not require the user to pre-classify tools by transport.

It looks across:

- installed skills
- enabled plugins
- configured MCP servers
- available CLIs
- workflow state already present in the repo

and then surfaces those as capabilities.

## After A Successful Bootstrap

You should end up with:

- `agentctl/state/bootstrap-report.json`
- `docs/agentctl/maintenance-report.json`
- `.codex-workflows/agentctl-maintenance/state.json`

Those files are the fastest way to confirm that the installed control plane is healthy on that machine.
