# Agent CLI OS Capability Registry

The machine-readable registry lives at `agentctl/state/capabilities.json` and is derived from the latest raw inventory snapshot.

## How To Use This Registry

- Treat `front_door` as the default interface an agent should choose first.
- Treat `backing_interfaces` as implementation detail and health metadata.
- Only care about raw CLI/MCP/plugin distinctions if a capability is degraded or missing.
- Use `overlap_policy` to understand why multiple interfaces collapse into one capability.

## Capability Menu

### Core

Control-plane entrypoints for install health, maintenance, and unattended worker routing.

- `autonomous-deep-runs` uses `$autonomous-deep-runs-capability` and is currently `ok`.
  - Overlap policy: The outer execute-until-done loop must use a real worker command, not chat memory. Prefer Codex runtime when it is callable or explicitly templated.
  - Page: `docs/agent-cli-os/capabilities/autonomous-deep-runs.md`
- `long-task-loops` uses `$loopsmith` and is currently `ok`.
  - Overlap policy: Use named deep workflows first. Use the generic durable loop only when the task is large, multi-step, and does not already fit a dedicated workflow skill.
  - Page: `docs/agent-cli-os/capabilities/long-task-loops.md`
- `skills-management` uses `$skills-management-capability` and is currently `ok`.
  - Overlap policy: Wrap official skills tooling rather than reimplementing it.
  - Page: `docs/agent-cli-os/capabilities/skills-management.md`
- `agentcli-maintenance` uses `$agentcli-maintenance-engineer` and is currently `ok`.
  - Overlap policy: Keep maintenance as one capability surface for docs, packaging, registry health, and platform drift.
  - Page: `docs/agent-cli-os/capabilities/agentcli-maintenance.md`
- `plugin-evaluation` uses `$plugin-eval:plugin-eval` and is currently `missing`.
  - Overlap policy: Keep plugin and skill evaluation behind one chat-first route instead of scattering analysis, budget, and benchmark commands through the default menu.
  - Page: `docs/agent-cli-os/capabilities/plugin-evaluation.md`

### Workflows

Reusable repo-level workflows for UI, tests, docs, refactors, CI/CD, and context upkeep.

- `context-workflows` uses `$context-skill` and is currently `ok`.
  - Overlap policy: Prefer the lightweight context skill and durable repo docs over deeper automation.
  - Page: `docs/agent-cli-os/capabilities/context-workflows.md`
- `ui-workflows` uses `$ui-skill / $ui-deep-audit` and is currently `ok`.
  - Overlap policy: Surface the UI skills first; plugin support stays a backing capability, not a separate menu.
  - Page: `docs/agent-cli-os/capabilities/ui-workflows.md`
- `test-workflows` uses `$test-skill / $test-deep-audit` and is currently `ok`.
  - Overlap policy: Collapse testing transports behind one testing surface; use repo-native CLIs and Playwright first.
  - Page: `docs/agent-cli-os/capabilities/test-workflows.md`
- `docs-workflows` uses `$docs-skill / $docs-deep-audit` and is currently `ok`.
  - Overlap policy: Keep docs work in the docs skills and hide transport details entirely.
  - Page: `docs/agent-cli-os/capabilities/docs-workflows.md`
- `refactor-workflows` uses `$refactor-skill / $refactor-deep-audit` and is currently `ok`.
  - Overlap policy: Use the local refactor skills as the capability surface; do not split by underlying tooling.
  - Page: `docs/agent-cli-os/capabilities/refactor-workflows.md`
- `cicd-workflows` uses `$cicd-skill / $cicd-deep-audit` and is currently `ok`.
  - Overlap policy: Surface CI/CD by workflow, not by whether GitHub or Vercel provides the underlying route.
  - Page: `docs/agent-cli-os/capabilities/cicd-workflows.md`
- `code-review` uses `$coderabbit:coderabbit-review` and is currently `missing`.
  - Overlap policy: Keep AI-powered code review under one explicit route: the CodeRabbit plugin skill plus a callable CodeRabbit runtime.
  - Page: `docs/agent-cli-os/capabilities/code-review.md`

### Research

Research routing and evidence creation before implementation.

- `research` uses `$research-capability` and is currently `ok`.
  - Overlap policy: Hide web, GitHub, and browser transport choices behind one research surface and one evidence contract.
  - Page: `docs/agent-cli-os/capabilities/research.md`

### Platforms

Vendor and platform integrations such as GitHub, Vercel, Supabase, Stripe, and Sentry.

- `github-workflows` uses `$github-capability` and is currently `ok`.
  - Overlap policy: Collapse GitHub plugin skills and gh into one capability entry instead of separate transport menus.
  - Page: `docs/agent-cli-os/capabilities/github-workflows.md`
- `github-advanced-security` uses `$github-security-capability` and is currently `ok`.
  - Overlap policy: Use `gh api` and `gh codeql` as the authoritative GitHub security routes, with `ghas-cli` as the rollout-at-scale helper when it is healthy. Do not assume generic GitHub plugin skills cover GHAS-specific work.
  - Page: `docs/agent-cli-os/capabilities/github-advanced-security.md`
- `vercel-platform` uses `$vercel-capability` and is currently `ok`.
  - Overlap policy: Keep one Vercel capability entry; plugin and CLI are primary, MCP stays background metadata.
  - Page: `docs/agent-cli-os/capabilities/vercel-platform.md`
- `supabase-data` uses `$supabase-capability` and is currently `ok`.
  - Overlap policy: Prefer the Supabase CLI for local stack, schema, migrations, and CI/CD. Use MCP when structured project access adds value beyond the CLI.
  - Page: `docs/agent-cli-os/capabilities/supabase-data.md`
- `stripe-payments` uses `$stripe-capability` and is currently `missing`.
  - Overlap policy: Prefer the Stripe plugin capability surface; keep MCP as backing metadata, not a separate menu.
  - Page: `docs/agent-cli-os/capabilities/stripe-payments.md`
- `sentry-observability` uses `$sentry-capability` and is currently `missing`.
  - Overlap policy: Expose Sentry as one observability capability instead of a transport-specific tool entry.
  - Page: `docs/agent-cli-os/capabilities/sentry-observability.md`

### Browser & design

Browser automation, Figma, and frontend runtime drill-down pages.

- `browser-automation` uses `$browser-capability` and is currently `ok`.
  - Overlap policy: Treat Playwright CLI and MCP as peer browser backends behind one browser capability.
  - Page: `docs/agent-cli-os/capabilities/browser-automation.md`
- `figma-design` uses `$figma-capability` and is currently `missing`.
  - Overlap policy: No plugin overlap here, so MCP remains the single capability entry.
  - Page: `docs/agent-cli-os/capabilities/figma-design.md`
- `nextjs-runtime` uses `$nextjs-runtime-capability` and is currently `missing`.
  - Overlap policy: Keep Next.js runtime tooling as one capability entry backed by Next DevTools MCP.
  - Page: `docs/agent-cli-os/capabilities/nextjs-runtime.md`

### Native

iOS, macOS, and Android development/testing capability front doors.

- `ios-development` uses `$ios-development-capability` and is currently `missing`.
  - Overlap policy: Expose iOS build, UI, and debugging workflows as one capability backed by the iOS plugin.
  - Page: `docs/agent-cli-os/capabilities/ios-development.md`
- `macos-development` uses `$macos-development-capability` and is currently `missing`.
  - Overlap policy: Expose macOS build, packaging, and desktop debugging as one capability backed by the macOS plugin.
  - Page: `docs/agent-cli-os/capabilities/macos-development.md`
- `android-testing` uses `$android-testing-capability` and is currently `missing`.
  - Overlap policy: Expose Android emulator QA as one capability backed by the Android testing plugin.
  - Page: `docs/agent-cli-os/capabilities/android-testing.md`
