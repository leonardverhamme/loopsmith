# Agent CLI OS Skill Map

This is the human-facing one-page map of the curated menu and the local front-door skills.

## What This Explains

- `$ui-skill` and `$ui-deep-audit` are still present. They live under `Workflows -> UI workflows`.
- `$context-skill` is still present. It lives under `Workflows -> Repo context workflows`.
- The `$` picker looks much larger because Codex also shows curated plugin skills, not just the local Agent CLI OS front-door skills.
- `$editskill` is the preferred direct helper for intentional skill-system changes. `$skill-edit-mode` stays as a legacy alias.
- If the active desktop thread still shows an old `$` list after a bundle sync, open a new thread or restart the app; the current session can keep a stale skill index.

## Direct Local Helpers

| Skill | Purpose | Note |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `doc` | - | skill is installed but not promoted into the curated front-door menu. |
| `editskill` | Use only when the user explicitly wants to create or change skill files and explicitly opens skill editing for the named targets. For substantial rewrites, evaluate before and after with plugin-eval. | Preferred front door for intentional skill-system changes. |
| `gitignore-skill` | Maintain `.gitignore` safely. Use when logs, test output, browser artifacts, local agent state, caches, build output, Graphify output, or temp files are cluttering `git status`, and the repo needs tighter ignore rules without hiding real source files. | skill is installed but not promoted into the curated front-door menu. |
| `graphify` | - | skill is installed but not promoted into the curated front-door menu. |
| `pdf` | - | skill is installed but not promoted into the curated front-door menu. |
| `skill-edit-mode` | Legacy alias for `$editskill`. Use only when the user explicitly wants to create or change skill files and explicitly opens skill editing for the named targets. | Legacy compatibility alias. Prefer `$editskill` in new chats. |
| `sora` | - | skill is installed but not promoted into the curated front-door menu. |

## Curated Plugin Catalog Summary

| Plugin family | Skill count | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `agent-cli-os` | 1 | `ok` |

## Raw Catalog

- `agentcli capabilities` is the compact front door.
- `agentcli capability ui-workflows` shows where the UI skills live.
- `agentcli capability context-workflows` shows where the context skill lives.
- `agentcli inventory show --kind skills` shows the raw installed skill catalog behind the compact menu.
- `agentcli skill-map` refreshes this page and the matching one-page PDF.

## Current Counts
