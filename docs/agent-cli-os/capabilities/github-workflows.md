## Routing Notes

- Prefer the GitHub capability skill when you need a quick route decision before acting.
- Use the GitHub plugin skills when they cover the task directly; use `gh` for direct CLI workflows and gaps in plugin coverage.

- `plugin` `github@openai-curated` [missing] (enabled=false)

## Overlap Policy
